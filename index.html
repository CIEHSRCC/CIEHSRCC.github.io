<h2 id="about-the-cieh-srcc">The Centre for Indian Economic History<br>Shri Ram College of Commerce</h2>
<p class="special-section3p">Given the immense importance of the subject matter of the India’s economic thoughts, philosophy, wisdom, history and tradition, and the relative lack of awareness and acknowledgement of the same, Shri Ram College of Commerce aspires to have a leadership role in creating and sustaining awareness, appreciation and discussions on the rich glory of India's diverse Economic History, Wisdom and Tradition. With this overarching vision, the Shri Ram College of Commerce established a <strong>Centre for Indian Economic History (CIEH, SRCC)</strong> towards developing and disseminating knowledge, research and related competencies on Economic History, Economic Thoughts and Economic Wisdoms of India. The CIEH, SRCC will undertake events and activities to reinvigorate research, discussion and discourse in Indian Economic History and Ancient Indian Economic Wisdom.

<h3 class="sectionh3">Backdrop of the Conference</h3>

<p class="sectionp"><span style="font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;">I</span>ndia’s economic growth story has been truly astounding. The economy of the Indus Valley Civilization, perhaps the most advanced ancient civilisation, is believed to have flourished significantly on trade. Citizens practised agriculture, domesticated animals, made sharp tools and weapons from copper, bronze and tin. There was a thriving maritime trade in terracotta pots, beads, gold and silver and coloured gem stones such as turquoise, lapis lazuli, metals, flints, seashells and pearls. Around 600 BCE, the Mahajanapadas minted punch-marked silver coins. The period of Ancient India was marked by intensive trade activity and urban development. In fact, from 1 CE all the way through the next two millennia up to 1700 CE, large scale industries such as mining, metallurgy, textiles, arts, and crafts flourished in India. Tracing the economic development and contribution of India during this period, Prof. Angus Maddison, renowned British economist, showed that India was the leading economic powerhouse of the world during this period of nearly two thousand years. His research, published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), placed India first on the list of nations with the country having such economic domination in the world economy, that India singlehandedly contributed nearly a fourth of the World’s GDP.<br><br> 
If India’s share in the world GDP was 30 % in Year 1 CE, as per Maddison’s research, it can be postulated that, in fact, India was enjoying already a very high degree of prosperity even prior to the Year 1 CE. This is evinced in historical records such as Records of the Economic History of Greco-Roman World which documents that nearly 2000 years ago, India was causing Roman Egypt to run out of its gold reserves by virtue of its surplus exports to Egypt and earnings in gold as returns. Another example in The historical records of the Indian Merchant Navy details that the Indian Merchant Navy possessed a fleet strength of 40,000 ships during Akbar’s reign and 34,000 ships before the British took over India. Even, the Bank of International Settlements’ (BIS) Annual Report 1934-1935 stated that between the years 1493 and 1930,<strong> India was accountable for absorbing 14% of the world's gold production indicating that India maintained the same level of export surplus over that entire period of time.</strong><br><br>
Yet during the British Rule, India's share of the world's GDP dropped significantly. Considering the level of economic prosperity India enjoyed and the sheer economic domination of the country in global trade, one may wonder,<br><br>

<em>What was the economic history of India during these periods?</em><br><br>

<em>How did India come to achieve such high level of economic development?</em><br><br> 

<em>What were the policy measures adopted in a land, that even in ancient times, was characterised by its social diversity and vast geography?</em><br><br> 

<em>What was the thought process behind the policy making in ancient India which led to high levels of economic development?</em><br><br> 

<em>What were the economic perspectives that shaped the Indian economy in the ancient times?</em><br><br>

The answers to these questions provide a deep and fascinating rationale into the study into economic history and economic thoughts of ancient India. The history of Indian economic thought offers fascinating insights into both economic issues and the policy making of ancient India. A study of the economic history of ancient India and ancient Indian economic thought would lead to a study of perhaps the world’s first progeniture of economic thought.<br><br>

Equally fascinating and rewarding would be a study of the economic perspectives in Vedas, Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Smritis, and Niti Shastras, particularly those of Manu and Shukra, which would provide for a detailed investigation into the ancient Indian economic thought. It may also be noted that early Indian economic thinkers such as Kautilya had sophisticated understanding of economics, with their ideas blending politics, ethics, and jurisprudence as evidenced in the Arthasastra and Manusmriti, two of the most well-known ancient Indian writings. Concepts such as dharma (righteousness, and truthfulness), varta (local economy), vasudha (land) and were central to Indian economic thought. Ideas such as charity and philanthropy, which are now being studied in welfare economics, were central to the idea of ancient Indian Economic thought as evidenced in the Rig Veda’s description of  charity as a voluntary act, rather than a fiat as in Abrahamic religions and the Bhagwat Gita prescribing three kinds of charity, <strong><em>satwik</em></strong>  (the one without expectations), <strong><em>rajas</em></strong>  (given grudgingly with expectations and <strong><em>tamas</em></strong>  (one provided with wrong causes and wrong times.) <br><br>

It is said that science without history is like a man without a memory. The same stands true for economic sciences as well. While the country’s post-independence administration and economic planning reflects shades of ancient Indian economic thought and wisdom, there is a conscious need to flesh out the economic history of India and the economic thoughts that shaped this history. The relative lack of literature, discourse, research and awareness on the subject matter of economic history and economic thought of ancient India present a compelling opportunity to deeply study and acknowledge our ancient wisdom, especially in turbulent times. It also presents an opportunity to look both introspectively at the economic development of ancient India and to understand India’s vivid history as a <em>“Vishwa Guru”</em> by looking at India’s contribution to the world economy, and economics since ancient times.
 </p>

<h3 class="sectionh3">Objective of the Conference</h3>
<p class="sectionp">The broad objective of the Two Day International Conference is to foster deep cultural appreciation for India's rich Economic History, Wisdom and Tradition since Ancient Times in academia, students and general public and to reinvigorate research, discussion and discourse in Indian Economic History and ancient Indian economic wisdom. 
</p>


<h3 class="sectionh3">Outcomes of the Conference</h3>
<p class="sectionp">Through the Conference, knowledge and research repositories on the subject matter of Indian Economic History and ancient Indian economic wisdom will be created. Select papers will be published in a book commemorating the Conference by a renowned publisher. The research, discussions and deliberations of the Conference will create self-sustaining platforms for discourse and discussions on the subject matter of Indian Economic History and ancient Indian economic wisdom and build research acumen and competencies amongst researchers and academicians.</p>
